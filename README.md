# Linear-codes
This is a simple and short project which is meant to demonstrate what linear codes are and how they work. It is a part of Linear Algebra 2 course at Warsaw University of Technology.
We use hamming distance as a metric to measure how two wectors differ from each other.
## The project consists of:
- encoding randomly generated vectors over a given field
- simulating sending the encoded vectors
- decoding the vectors using MinimizeHammingDistance algorythm
- showing the results as heatmaps (see Image_before_encoding.png and Image_after_decoding.png)
